        <h3>father of gravity </h3>
        <h5>Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727), often called the "father of gravity," was an English physicist and mathematician whose
        work revolutionized science. He is best known for formulating the law of universal gravitation, which explained that
        every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force proportional to their masses and inversely
        proportional to the square of the distance between them.
        Beyond gravity, Newton also developed the three laws of motion, laid the foundations of calculus, and made significant
        contributions to optics. His most famous work, Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687), unified celestial and
        terrestrial mechanics under the same principles, showing that the force pulling an apple to the ground is the same force
        that governs planetary motion.
